    <!-- Using the inspect/dev tools I was able to get most of the widths and heights and other 
    properties that wernt specified in the instructions, using the solve though, I was able to to make my style.css more 
    succinct by borrowing groupings that were not intitally obivous to me. 

    I realize I am resubmitting this homework and that it is/ should have been easy for me to complete at this point,
    I have no problem re-doing the "recommended homework" for this unit if that would make it more "fair"? just let me know.
    Although, I am going to re-do the unit three hw also which is basiaclly the recommended hw for this unit-->
